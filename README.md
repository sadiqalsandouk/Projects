# Zigzag Finch Robot
The task is to create a program to allow the finch (a small robot which can be programmed to perform tasks) to perform a zigzag at the user’s desired settings while producing sound and emitting lights. 

Features of the program includes: 
 User input: 
*Length of a zigzag section (in cm) 
*Number of zigzag sections (all sections will have the same length) 

Display an error message if the values are: 
*not in between the range 20cm-80cm for the length of each section 
*not an even number for the amount of sections of the zigzag (no more than 10) Including the ability to produce an error message to re-enter the appropriate values. 

*Speed of the finch robot to be generated randomly  

*LED of finch set to green once the user has input the desired settings.

*A sound will play as it moves, this is the initial sound and will change once the finch begins to travel to the second section. 

*A second tune will play, and the LED will be set to red.  This will repeat after each section. 
(green and initial sound, red and second sound – alternating after each section) 

*Once finch completes travelling the given zigzag sections, it will reverse and 
retrace the sections to reach the original position before the program was initiated.
LED should turn off and the sound should stop. 

A text file must be created including: 
*Length of the path (start and end of zigzag, not including the return) 
*The distance travelled (from the start position to the end position of the zigzag) 
*Start and end time. 

Additional functionalities of the program includes:  
*The finch will buzz once the program is complete. 
*The finch will flash a yellow LED once the program is complete. 
*The finch will trigger a jingle from the system running the program once the program is complete.  
*On the text file, it will include how long it took the finch to complete the program. 
*The ‘time taken to complete’ requirement will make the program more interesting as the user can experiment with different settings and compare time taken for different settings used for the Zigzag program. All other additional requirements will create the sense of satisfaction for the user and ensure they understand the program is complete and therefore will eliminate any uncertainty. Making the program more user-friendly as well as easy to learn, use and understand.
